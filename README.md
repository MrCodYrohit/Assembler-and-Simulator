# Assembler-and-Simulator


Tech-stack:
Python
Matplotlib
An assembler + simulator based on a simple 16 bit instruction set architecture. This was the course project for Computer Organization course at IIITD.

Assembler
The input to the assembler is a text file containing the assembly instructions. The assembler is capable of-

Handling instructions specified in assignment
Handling labels
Handling variables
If the code is error free, then the corresponding binary is generated to standard output (stdout). In the output, each line is a 16 bit binary number written using 0s and 1s in ASCII.

Simulator
Reads input from stdin (the format is the same as the format of the binary file generated by the assembler)
Loads the binary in the system memory at the beginning, and then starts executing the code at address 0
The code is executed until hlt is reached.
After execution of each instruction, the simulator outputs one line containing an 8 bit number denoting the program counter
This is followed by 8 space separated 16 bit binary numbers denoting the values of the registers (R0, R1, ... R6 and FLAGS).
<PC (8 bits)><space><R0 (16 bits)><space>...<R6 (16 bits)><space><FLAGS (16 bits)>

The output is written to stdout. Similarly, the input must be read from stdin. After the program halts, the memory dump of the whole memory is printed.
